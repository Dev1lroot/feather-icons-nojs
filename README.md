# feather-icons-nojs

This Git repository hosts a collection of icons in CSS format, designed to be used without JavaScript. The icons in this pack were collected from [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/), an open-source icon pack.

## Usage

To use an icon, simply add the corresponding CSS class to an HTML element, following this format:

```html
<i class="fe fe-icon-name"></i>
```

## Build

You can also place your own icons into the `./dist/icons` folder or remove some icons. Afterward, rebuild the CSS pack using the `build.js` file and Node.js.

Feel free to explore and adapt this icon pack to suit your project's needs!
